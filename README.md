This part of the project enhances the chatbot by implementing more advanced features and optimizations. The CyberSecurityChatbot now includes:

Key Features:
Memory Recall: The chatbot can remember the user's name and the last topic discussed, which it recalls upon the next session.

Sentiment Detection: The chatbot can recognize emotional expressions from the user (e.g., "I'm worried," "I'm frustrated") and respond with supportive messages.

Tips and Advice: When the user asks for tips on specific cybersecurity topics (e.g., "scam tips," "password tips"), the chatbot provides helpful advice in a list format.

Keyword Recognition: The chatbot can identify and respond to various cybersecurity topics such as phishing, malware, scams, privacy, and more.

Randomized Responses: The chatbot provides diverse responses to keep the interaction dynamic and engaging.

Delegate and Lambda Expressions: The project uses delegates and lambda expressions to handle chatbot responses efficiently and in a structured way.

The chatbot's main goal is to educate users on cybersecurity topics while maintaining an engaging and supportive conversation flow.


HOW TO USE IT:
If you are looking for a tip on a specific keyword you should just ask : "scam tips" - the word "tips" is very important otherwise the bot will not attend to your request.
